# PictoralFin
Open-source Picture/Stop-Motion Editor

Hello!

I enjoy making Lego stop motion shorts. I always used Windows Live Movie Maker, but I no longer have access to that :'(. I searched the internet for other free stop motion programs, and found very few. Each one I tried had a hidden cost, or didn't work. I then began to develop my own stop motion editor, and ta-da, PictoralFin was born! It started as a simple picture editor, but after discovering the Java wrappers for FFmpeg, it became a video editor!

Right now, it runs on Windows 10, OS X, and Debian Linux (tested on OpenSUSE). I am working towards a release and getting close!

If you would like to work on this project, go ahead! For questions, you can email me at fishtankapps@gmail.com!

Thank-you,
Whitaker Kohls
