# PictoralFin
Open-source Picture/Stop-Motion Editor

Hello!
My name is Whitaker Kohls and this is my project!

I enjoy making Lego stop motion shorts. I always used Windows Live Movie Maker, but I no longer have access to that :'(. I searched the internet for other free stop motion programs, and found very few. Each one I tried had a hidden cost, or didn't work. I then began to develop my own stop motion editor, and ta-da, PictoralFin was born! It started as a simple picture editor, but after discovering the Java wrappers for FFmeg, it became a video editor!

Currently, I am updating the layout to allow for more improvements, so there a LOT of unused code. I am working on the PictoralFin Object and system. The older version is PictoralFinKinetic.

If you would like to work on this project, go ahead! For questions, you can email me at fishtankapps@gmail.com!

Thank-you,
Whitaker Kohls
